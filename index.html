<h3>Background</h3>

<p>All of us in the group are avid sports fans, and we would like to explore the sports betting market to see if it is efficient, or if there is an opportunity to profit from betting in a certain pattern consistently. It’s a market that is oftentimes invisible, but a fascinating one nonetheless. According to ESPN, “more than $3.6 billion was wagered on sports at Nevada sports books in 2013” while estimates for illegal betting tops $380 billion. This topic is especially of interest after recent pushes for legalization in the US, which is currently only legal in Nevada and through offshore websites. Recent supporters include Adam Silver, the commissioner of the NBA, calling for the federal legalization of sports betting in the US as a common sense solution given the amount of illicit betting already at play and the potential for sports betting as a budgetary aid. This stands in contrast to similar systems in Europe, where sports betting in legal and volumes are significantly higher than comparable sports in the U.S.</p>

<p>Given the potential of sports betting in the U.S. and our collective interest in the topic, we want to explore the relationship between the structures and incentives of sports betting markets, comparing the efficiency of this market relative to financial markets, and observe where inefficiencies might arise. One piece of research of particular interest to us were the studies of Steven Levitt, who argues in a 2004 paper that bookmakers “do not play the traditional role of market makers matching buyers and sellers but, rather, take large positions with respect to the outcome of game” and bias the odds against favorites. In our project, we want to dive deeper into this hypothesis as well as take a look at what other factors might come into play regarding systematic over/undervaluation in placing odds in the world of sports betting.</p>

<p>As seen above, I show the means of the binary indicator, WPS, by year. For each game, WPS indicates whether the actual spread from the favorite's perspective beat the predicted spread. The bars represent the 95% confidence interval assuming a Student's t-distribution. As the number of observations is very large each year (with over 1200 total matches in the regular season), then by the central limit theorem the means should be normally distributed, allowing us to use the Student's t-distribution.</p>
<p>As seen, the mean of WPS for each year is not statistically significant from 0.5 for most of the years between 2000 to 2013. This suggests that betting odds are good predictors of the actual result as 50% of the time the spread is greater then predicted and 50% of the time it is less.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the mean values of WPS before 2011 seem to be below the 50% mark, suggesting that betting odds odds are biased against the favorites. In other words, they underpredict the probably of the favorite winning. This makes sense and is consistent with the literature (http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-people-bet-on-the-favorite-even-when-the-spread-favors-the-underdog/). There is a tendency for people to place their bets on the favorite team (perhaps for psychological reasons), which means that the gambling companies can increase the point spread, making it harder for the favorite to beat and thus shifting the odds slightly to favor the underdog. Nevertheless, the results are not statistically significance at the 10% level except for in the years 1994, 2006, and 2010.</p>
