<h3>Background</h3>

<p>In both NBA and NFL betting, the odds are given in the form of a spread. For instance, when the Los Angeles Lakers plays the Cleveland Cavaliers, the spread from the Lakersâ€™ perspective is the points that they score minus the points that the Cavaliers score. Theoretically, if betting spreads were perfect predictors of the outcome of each game, then we would expect any given team to beat the spread with 50% probability on any given night, and it would be impossible to consistently profit from betting on sports games. However, we wanted to see if we would be able to find a strategy that allows us to pick a team for each game such that the probability that our chosen team wins on any given night is better than 50%.</p>

<p>However, in reality, being better than 50% is not enough because the odds makers take a small commission for every bet. So, how correct do we have to be if we want to profit from sports betting? If the odds maker takes 9% as commission (http://sports.bovada.lv/sports-betting/nba-basketball-lines.jsp), then over the course of n bets, we need be correct with probability p to break even:</p>

<pre>
p * n * (1.91 * bet-size) = n * bet-size
p = 52.4 %
</pre>

<p>Therefore, in order for us to profit from sports betting, we need to win at least 52.4% of the time.</p>

<h3>Betting against the favored team.</h3>

<p>Interestingly, a simple strategy of consistency betting against the favored team would be profitable if there was no commission taken. This is consistent with what has been noted in literature already, and indicates that odds makers are taking into account the human tendency to overestimate the spread. People are generally good at predicting which team is going to win. However, once people decide on who is the favorite, they generally tend to overestimate how much the favorite will win by. Therefore, the spread is generally set against the favorite team by the odds makers.</p>

We see that although the simple strategy described above would work in a world where odds makers do not take commission, but it is not successful enough (not over 52.4% consistently) to beat a more realistic market. Therefore, we look for another strategy.

<h3>Using random forests</h3>
<p>We had a theory that the odds makers would set the odds against popular teams. We decided to look at a few characteristics which we thought may provide us information about</p>
